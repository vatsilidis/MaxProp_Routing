MaxProp: Routing for Vehicle-Based Disruption-Tolerant Networks Algorithm


## 
This is the algorithm that implemented by me as a graduate project for the course  Delay Tolerant and Opportunistic Networks, at Computer Science and ENgineering @ University of Ioannina the year 2013-2014.


## The base algorithm 
Was first introduced by Burgess, J.; Gallagher, Brian; Jensen, D.; Levine, B.N., MaxProp: Routing for Vehicle-Based Disruption-Tolerant Networks, INFOCOM 2006. 25th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. Proceedings , vol., no., pp.1,11, April 2006.

## Run
To run it you must dowload the ONE simulator. ONE is a simulator used exclusively to simulate DTNs networks. It is implemented in Java and also has an advanced GUI. This is an [advanced documentation of ONE] (http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/javadoc_v141/)
